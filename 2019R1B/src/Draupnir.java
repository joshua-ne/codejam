/**
 * The Draupnir from Google Code Jam Round-1B 2019.
 * https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051706/0000000000122837
 * 
 * The six values are spaced apart by decreasing powers of two, such that
 * the sum for the n-th day is:
 * R1*2^n + R2*2^(n/2) + R3*2^(n/3) + R4*2^(n/4) + R5*2^(n/5) + R6*2^(n/6)
 * 
 * If we find an n such that those powers of 2 are spaced more than 100 units
 * apart (say 128, that is 7 bits), we can find each Ri by bit-masking.
 * n=210 does the job, as 210/6=35, 210/5=42 and 210/4=52, so they are spaced
 * at least 7 bits apart.
 * But we cannot do this in one pass, because 2^210 does not fit in the
 * daily sum modulo 2^63 we can ask for.
 * 
 * So we can use n=210 to find the three least significant rings, and
 * n=48 (as 48/3=16, 48/2=24 and 48 are spaced at least 7 bits apart)
 * to find the three most significant rings.
